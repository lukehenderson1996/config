Solution for creating your own script (don't use):

first create a .sh file

then


I think it would be better to use a launcher file for your script by creating a ~/Desktop/ssh_home.desktop file with the following contents:

[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Exec=/home/yourname/bin/ssh_home.sh
Name=SSH Server
GenericName=SSH Server
Comment=Connect to My Server
Encoding=UTF-8
Terminal=true
Type=Application
Categories=Application;Network;

That way you will have a clickable icon which will launch your script.

You may have to also set the executable flag with chmod:

chmod +x ~/Desktop/ssh_home.desktop
